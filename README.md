# Teensy 4.1 Early Ethernet Experiments

DO NOT USE this old experimental code.  For usable Ethernet on Teensy 4.1,
use the QNEthernet or NativeEthernet libraries which provide a complete
Ethernet networking library.

This old code was only the very early experimental code used to first test
the Ethernet hardware and begin development of a low-level driver.
